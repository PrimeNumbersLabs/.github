# Prime Numbers Labs

Prime Numbers Labs is an omnichain DeFi development studio.  
We build interoperable protocols that let your assets move freely and earn more, no matter which chain you’re on.

## Mission

Our goals:

- **Liberate DeFi** – unify fragmented liquidity so users can borrow, lend, trade or stake on the chain that suits them best.  
- **Keep it safe & simple** – audited contracts, cross-chain messaging via LayerZero, and UX that hides the complexity behind a clean interface.
